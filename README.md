**INTRO**

As someone who has experienced the frustration of waiting in line for hours at the doctor's office, I knew there had to be a better way. I created ZeeHealth, a doctor's appointment booking app, to streamline the process of scheduling medical appointments and make healthcare more accessible. With ZeeHealth, patients can easily find available time slots, book appointments online, and receive reminders - all from the comfort of their own homes. My goal is to reduce wait times, increase patient satisfaction, and improve the overall healthcare experience. By leveraging technology to simplify appointment booking, I hope to make a positive impact on the lives of patients and healthcare providers alike.

ZeeHealth offers a user-friendly online platform for patients to easily search, book, and manage appointments with their healthcare providers. The app streamlines the booking process, reduces wait times, and improves patient satisfaction.
